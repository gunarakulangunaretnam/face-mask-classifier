## Introduction

The Face Mask Classifier Prototype is a web application that classifies images as "with-mask" or "without-mask". This prototype showcases the integration of Teachable Machine for model training and TensorFlow.js for real-time inference directly within a web browser. Its primary function is classifying whether individuals wear face masks correctly based on webcam input. This project is a practical example of building and deploying a basic image classification system.

**Note:** This AI model was trained with TechableMachine, a No-Code AI platform used for educational purposes. However, it is not suitable for production or enterprise purposes due to its lower performance quality.
